# Privacy-Preserving-for-Health-care-data-using-java
In this project, we propose an attribute-focused privacy preserving data publishing scheme. 
The proposed scheme is two-fold, comprising a fixed interval approach to protect numerical attributes and an improved l-diverse slicing approach to protect the categorical and sensitive attributes. In the fixed-interval approach, the original values of the healthcare data are replaced with an equivalent computed value. 
The improved l-diverse slicing approach partitions the data both horizontally and vertically 
to avoid privacy leaks.
